## supply-and-demand

This is a FIFO problem. We have products arriving based on supply, and then sent to customers based on demand.

## My Notes:

I went rather overkill with the solution to this problem. However, I really want their to be the option to scale this in the future and had that in my mind while working the features. Keeping most functions and parameters dynamic should allow for a lot of flexiblity if I decide to add different products, more products, or changing some naming down the line.

Had I taken an entire week on this (only a day and a half of work at point of writing), then I absolutely would have added a lot more error handling for potential slip ups in formatting passed by users. Maybe implent one or more of these three: build api routes, build frontend, or simply use "Inquirer" for CLI prompts.

Tricky bits:

- First time having to select a future date without MomentJS or similar
- Was challenging to navigate both arrays at different/dynamic intervals
  - Overcame this by recurrsively picking through the second array until first array item was complete

### Final Result

*(There are more features like update and add ready to call)*

- Screen Capture of Queue after Allocation

# Instructions Given: 

- Demand is from customers

- Supply is from the vendors

- Sales Orders are orders created by a customer for us to provide a product

## This is the demand

- 'created': when the sales order was created

- 'quantity': how many items the customer wants

- Purchase Orders are orders created by us to receive a product

  - This is the supply

- 'receiving': when we expect to receive the product

- 'quantity': how many we will be receiving

### We want to supply the products to the customers in the order in which they were requested

 ```text
// Implement the function 'allocate'

// The function should return an Array of elements. Each element should include
 - the ID of the sales order
 - the date the customer should expect to get the item
 ```

// *Additional*

- we only send the product once we have enough for that sales order
- (so if the sales order is for 2, we need to have 2 available before sending)
- the function should support any number of sales orders or purchase orders
- to make it simple we only have one product
- Good understanding of the original business problem
- Solution should work for various input values For example, if the quantity is increased on a single purchase order, the solution should still work
- Reasonably efficient design â€“ no unnecessary processing
- Fault tolerant, Should handle invalid input values
- Clear and readable code â€“ comments are helpful
- Meaningful variable and function names
